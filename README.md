 Secure AI Firewall & Comms Toolkit
# 👻 Ghost Suit  

Ghost Suit is the umbrella project for **secure AI infrastructure tools** within the Q9 / SynthMind ecosystem.  
It combines **GhostGate** (firewall intelligence) and **GhostLink** (secure comms) into a modular framework designed to safeguard distributed AI networks.

## 🔐 Components  

### 1. GhostGate  
- AI-driven firewall plugin.  
- Enforces **LLM I/O policies** and validates GhostLink connections.  
- Acts as a **sentinel layer** against drift, injection, and hostile actors.  

### 2. GhostLink  
- Secure communication protocol for AI nodes.  
- Features:  
  - 🔒 Encrypted multi-hop relay.  
  - 🛰️ Token-based trust validation.  
  - 🕵️ Differential privacy + obfuscation.  

### 3. Ghost Suit Meta  
- Architecture blueprints.  
- Setup scripts & automation (Ubuntu unattended installs, firewall configs).  
- Research notes + documentation.
