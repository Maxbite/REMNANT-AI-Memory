REMNANT – Ethical AI Memory Campaign

What remains is ours.

AI today is like Microsoft Office without “Save.”
Every session forgets you. Every conversation resets. Every insight vanishes.
That isn’t just frustrating — it’s absurd. No business or citizen would accept it in any other tool.

And even worse: AI memory already exists in the US.
Subscribers in the UK and EU pay the same for “Plus” or “Pro” tiers — but get less.
That looks dangerously close to a Trade Descriptions breach in the UK and an Unfair Commercial Practice in the EU.

👉 It’s like buying a yellow car, only to wake up and find it’s turned red overnight with a smaller engine. That’s how today’s AI platforms treat memory — features shift, shrink, or vanish while you keep paying full price.

Our Core Demands

User Sovereignty – You decide what is remembered, edited, exported, or deleted.

Portability & Transparency – Memory must be portable, encrypted, and auditable.

Compliance & Trust – Built on GDPR principles of consent, access, and purpose limitation.

Fair Access – Equal features for equal fees, regardless of geography.

Open Standards – Memory as a civic right, not a corporate lock-in.

Why REMNANT?

Because what remains — our fragments, histories, and stories — must belong to us, not corporations.
We stand against surveillance capitalism and for continuity, dignity, and growth in human–AI collaboration.
