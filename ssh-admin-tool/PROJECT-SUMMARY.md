### Key Design Principles
- **Implied Consent**: Installation implies administrative consent
- **Reverse Tunneling**: Clients initiate connections for firewall compatibility
- **Auto-Discovery**: Multiple methods for finding tunnel servers
- **Resilient Operation**: Automatic reconnection and error recovery
- **Centralized Management**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Tunnel Establishment
- Clients automatically establish reverse SSH tunnels to parent servers
- Support for multiple parent servers with priority-based failover
- Configurable port mappings for different services (SSH, RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, WinRM)

### ✅ Auto-Reconnection & Monitoring
- Intelligent reconnection with exponential backoff
- Health monitoring with configurable intervals
- Comprehensive logging to files and Windows Event Log
- Service-level operation for persistent connectivity

### ✅ Network Discovery
- **DNS SRV Records**: `_ssh-tunnel._tcp.domain.com`
- **Broadcast Discovery**: UDP broadcast for local network discovery
- **Network Scanning**: Automated scanning of IP ranges
- **Known Hosts**: Analysis of SSH configuration files

### ✅ Web Management Interface
- Real-time client status monitoring
- Tunnel visualization with statistics
- Connection history and trends
- Client deployment tools
- System health monitoring

### ✅ Security & Authentication
- SSH key-based authentication (RSA 4096-bit)
- Dedicated user accounts for tunnel clients
- Firewall-friendly reverse tunnel architecture
- Comprehensive audit logging

### ✅ Windows Service Integration
- Runs as Windows service for persistent operation
- Proper service lifecycle management
- Windows Event Log integration
- Service health monitoring and recovery
