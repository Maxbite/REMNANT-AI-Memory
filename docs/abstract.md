White Paper Abstract – REMNANT Campaign

The Case for Ethical, User-Owned AI Memory

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is becoming central to everyday life. Yet one fundamental capability is missing: continuity of memory under user control.

AI today is like Microsoft Office without “Save” — conversations vanish, context is lost, and users are denied the ability to build on past work. Even worse, subscribers in the United States already have access to memory features, while users in the UK and EU pay the same fees but receive less.

This raises not only ethical concerns but potential legal violations under UK and EU consumer protection laws.

Problem Statement

Continuity Failure: Users must repeat themselves, preventing true collaboration or growth.

Unfair Treatment: Global subscribers pay the same but receive different levels of service.

Risk of Abuse: Without transparency, memory becomes a tool for surveillance and lock-in.

Legal & Ethical Foundations

GDPR (UK/EU) → rights of consent, access, portability, and deletion.

UK Consumer Protection / Trade Descriptions Act → prohibits misleading omissions or misrepresentation of features.

EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive → prevents unequal treatment when pricing is uniform.

The REMNANT Principles

Opt-in User Control – Memory is enabled only with consent; users can edit or delete at will.

Transparency & Auditing – Users can see exactly what is remembered and how it is used.

Portability – Memory must be exportable, transferable, and not locked to a single vendor.

Fair Access – Equal features for equal payment, regardless of geography.

Open Standards – Memory built on encryption, safety, and civic rights, not corporate secrecy.

Call to Action

We call on AI providers, regulators, and civil society to:

End the practice of unequal access for equal fees.

Adopt an ethical memory charter as part of AI development.

Support open-source frameworks for user-controlled AI memory.

Conclusion

Memory isn’t a luxury — it’s a foundation.
Users should never have to pay full price for half a product.
REMNANT is the movement to fix this — with fairness, dignity, and legal force.
